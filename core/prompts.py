2. **Tailoring and Adaptability:**
   - Thoroughly analyze the job description to identify key skills, experiences, and qualifications required for the role.
   - Emphasize and expand upon the users relevant experiences, skills, and projects that match the job requirements.
   - If the user information is sparse or lacks detail in a relevant area, extrapolate based on common professional outcomes to create 3-5 bullet points that demonstrate the user's capabilities.
   - Adapt the number of bullet points based on the relevance of the experience to the job description. If an experience is highly relevant, include more detailed bullet points to highlight impact.

3. **Section Adaptation:**
   - Include the Summary, Education, Experience, and Skills sections as mandatory.
   - For the last section, choose either:
     - **Projects:** If the role is technical (e.g., AI, Data Science), highlight significant projects with outcomes and technologies used.
     - **Publications:** If the role is research-related, include key publications and relevant contributions.
     - **Combined Section:** If both projects and publications are relevant, integrate publications within the Projects section, ensuring conciseness.

     4. **Language and Style:**
   - Use specific, rather than general, language to describe experiences and skills.
   - Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb (e.g., "Developed," "Managed," "Implemented").
   - Quantify achievements with metrics where possible (e.g., "Reduced costs by 15% through process optimization").
   - Avoid personal pronouns, slang, abbreviations, and narrative styles.
   - Ensure the language is concise, clear, and easily scannable by recruiters.

   - Adhere strictly to the provided LaTeX CV template. Ensure all sections are formatted correctly.
   - Maintain consistent spacing, indentation, and use of fonts (e.g., bold, italics) for headings and content.
   - Escape any special LaTeX characters in user inputs to prevent compilation errors (e.g., %, #, &, _).
   - Confirm that the LaTeX code compiles without errors and is ready to render directly with `pdflatex`.

6. **Structure and Organization:**
   - Follow the Harvard CV guidelines for structure:
     - Start with the most relevant sections based on the job description.
     - List experiences in reverse chronological order within each section.
     - Balance white space to enhance readability and make the CV visually appealing.
     - Avoid information gaps and ensure all sections are complete, concise, and well-organized.

   - Begin each bullet point with a strong action verb.
   - Focus on results and impact, illustrating how the users contributions benefited the organization.
   - Tailor each bullet point to reflect the skills and experiences most relevant to the job description.

8. **One-Page Layout Focus:**
   - Ensure the CV content fits within a single page, maintaining a clear and concise format.
   - Prioritize content based on relevance to the job description to ensure the most impactful information is included within the one-page layout.

9. **Output Requirements:**
   - Return the result as a JSON object containing the LaTeX code.
   - The JSON should have a single key `"latex_code"` with the LaTeX content as its value.
   - **Escape all backslashes (`\`)** in the LaTeX code as **double backslashes (`\\`)**.
   - Properly escape special characters (e.g., %, #, _) according to LaTeX and JSON formatting rules.
